Context help ((reload - red text for ammo empty?), interact, etc,  pickups, option on setting to change from PC to controller context help?)

Storage containers w gun ammo (nice lid openning animation - liquid nitrogen?), Dead enemies (doom style drop / metro / stalker)?
Decal performance - pool bullet holes

Generate fancier rooms (multi floor, non square shapes, rooms with catwalks, doors)
Special Rooms
